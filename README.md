Mass Spectrum Primitives and Functions to Manipulate Raw Mass Spectrum Data Files


## ms_peaks

A library to read and manipulate raw text or mzXML files generated by [at least Mahdi] Mass Spectrometers.

Description of primary data type: Peaks

Peaks are a tuple of two numpy arrays, of which the first array contains values of mz and the
second the values of intensity. The data type is not strictly enforced as a class,
but could easily be implemented as such. (Types are loosely defined in Haskell Style)

- Type Peaks = ([mz], [intensity])

- Type mz = [Float]

- Type Intensity = [Int]
